Timestamp (UTC): 2025-12-21T21:05:00Z

## Checklist
- [x] Replace extraction win with wave-clear progression (champion every 5th, boss every 10th).
- [x] Switch merges to 2048-style adjacent pair merges with no tier cap.
- [x] Add settings screen (screen shake, grid, debug overlay).
- [x] Add dev console/mod menu (numpad decimal toggle).
- [x] Mark engine silhouette complete (cartoon locomotive silhouette).
- [x] Improve render scaling/AA for higher clarity on movement.
- [x] Tighten camera framing (zoom in early, zoom out with length).
- [x] Boost pickup readability and reduce bullet dominance.
- [x] Add micro weapon feedback (muzzle flash + enemy hit flash).
- [x] Slow early pickup cadence to soften early merge spikes.
- [x] Scale spawn padding with train length to reduce dead space.
- [ ] Minor car silhouette polish (small shape cues only).
- [ ] Decide + document car reordering mechanic (and implement if approved).
- [ ] Add Armored + Ranger enemies.
- [ ] Add UI scale toggle (small/medium/large).
- [ ] Add audio + light VFX polish.
- [ ] Balance wave scaling, pickups, and tier growth.

## Current State (Brief)
- Wave-based run loop with champions/bosses, pair-merge system, and auto-fire combat.
- Menu + settings + end screen, HUD shows wave status.
- Higher-resolution rendering with smoothing; camera zoom scales with train length.
- Pickups have clearer glow/outline; weapon hits flash; muzzle flashes added.
- Dev console available on numpad decimal for spawn/debug shortcuts.
- Spawn padding scales with train length to keep composition readable.
